# Pintasso

I made this application to present the Android Picasso framework.
This application is inspired by Pinterest and displays images related to the research carried out. Images are from the Unsplash API.
The application contains two activities one with the framework the other without to allow comparison.

This project was carried out as part of the Mobile Development module of the MIAGE master 2 in Nantes.
